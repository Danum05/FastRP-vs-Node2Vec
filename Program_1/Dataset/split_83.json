But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.",

His body doesn't move and he has no senses, but only his ears can be heard. The voice of his son and his wife, who lived together, made him wonder if he was going to night and died in a pitiful way.  Even though it was a night out, his liquor-loving boy had removed his squirrel. Her son's daughter-in-law, Maya, came to Minoru, who couldn't yell at him and was amazed. She thought she was a well-made bride and wasted on her son. It also has a sexual meaning. Eventually, I heard the voice of an unknown man, different from her son. Maya called the man \"Mr. Matsuda\" and began to roar beside his body, uttering a hailless voice. Minoru's desire to see opened her one eye a little. But by that time things were done.",
